History

Created by David Nadoba:

Implementation of different pathfinding algorithms by using a bidirectional and weighted graph data structure `WeightedGraph`. You can find a generic implementation of such a graph struct in `WeightedGraph.swift` and its related protocols.  
This was my first macOS App and it uses only cocoa bindings in the `RouteSummaryViewController`.   

I wrote this App for the [Code Competition "Der Handlungsreisende"](https://www.it-talents.de/foerderung/code-competition/code-competition-02-2017) from [IT-Talents.de](https://www.it-talents.de/).
